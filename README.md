BorrowTransactions (TransactionID, BookID, MemberID, BorrowDate, ReturnDate) 

Fines (FineID, TransactionID, FineAmount, PaidStatus) 

 

Task 2: Inserting Data 

 Insert at least 15 books, 10 members, and 20 borrow transactions into the tables. 

 

 Insert at least 5 fines, some marked as "paid" and some as "unpaid."
